Hi, 

As I agreed I have created the Chrome extension to refresh and alert functionality. This the demo video of the same.


As I mentioned, I have created chrome extension called PageRefresher,I have created the Option page where you can set the refresh internal.

Now, you can see like the page set refresh between configured time.

Let's consider if you get availability in slot (as this production environment of other site, I am doing DOM level changes to replicate the similar kind of situation).

Once, any availability is slot is observed Chrome will send you the notification.

and stops refresh.
